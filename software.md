*[NicInfo](https://github.com/arineng/nicinfo)* NicInfo is a general purpose, command line Registry Data Access Protocol (RDAP) client released under an open source, ISC derivative BSD style license. RDAP is an HTTP-based RESTful protocol defined by the IETF as a replacement for Whois.

*[RDAP Bootstrap Server](https://github.com/arineng/rdap_bootstrap_server)* The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) defines a bootstrapping process in RFC 7484. A bootstrap server aids clients by reading the bootstrapping information published by IANA and using it to send HTTP redirects to RDAP queries. Clients utilizing a bootstrap server will not need to conduct their own bootstrapping.

*[JSON Content Rules validator](https://github.com/arineng/jcrvalidator)* JSON Content Rules (JCR) is a language for specifying and testing the interchange of data in JSON format used by computer protocols and processes. The syntax of JCR is not JSON but is "JSON-like", possessing the conciseness and utility that has made JSON popular. It was created by the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN) in an effort to better describe the JSON structures in protocols such as RDAP.

*[RDAP WebSPA](https://github.com/arineng/rdap_webspa)* (experimental) This is a BootstrapJS, JQuery Javascript Web-based Single Page Application client for the Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP).

*[Ruby Zonefile](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/zonefile/1.04/Zonefile)* (patch contributor) Added support for the DNSSEC resource records.
