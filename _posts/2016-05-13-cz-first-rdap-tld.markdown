I just noticed that IANA has updated their [bootstrap](http://data.iana.org/rdap/dns.json) files,
and NIC.CZ, the Czech TLD, is in there.

**UPDATE :**
Because the RDAP IANA files have been updated soooooooo infrequently, it has gone unnoticed that [NicInfo](https://github.com/arineng/nicinfo)
was not bootstrapping properly. That has now been fixed in
[1.1.1](https://github.com/arineng/nicinfo/releases/tag/1.1.1).
