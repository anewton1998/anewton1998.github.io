Is Java the new COBOL? It could be, and if so that wouldn't be a bad thing.

The "Java is the new COBOL" debate has been going on for about 10 years now.
And it's not just theoretical. There are companies catering to what they sense
is a shifting mindset in the enterprise programming world -- a mindset that
many of us would probably find unfamiliar.

If you want to know what I'm talking about, do a Google search for ["Java for COBOL programmers"](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Java+for+COBOL+programmers).
You'll find lot's of resources for the COBOL programmer to learn Java. That highlights
two things: 1) there are still quite a few COBOL programmers out there (stunning, right?),
and 2) there is interest in moving them to Java.
