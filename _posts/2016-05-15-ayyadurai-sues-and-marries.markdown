> This fracas resurfaced in 2014 when Ayyadurai married Fran Drescher.

from an [article](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/05/man-who-claims-to-have-invented-e-mail-sues-gawker-for-35m-in-libel-suit/) at Ars Technica about Shiva Ayyadurai suing Gawker Media for libel.

Gawker's Gizmodo published several articles [(1)](http://gizmodo.com/5888702/corruption-lies-and-death-threats-the-crazy-story-of-the-man-who-pretended-to-invent-e-mail) [(2)](http://gizmodo.com/5887480/the-inventor-of-e-mail-did-not-invent-e-mail) on Shiva Ayyadurai and the result:

> Months after these articles appeared, Boston Magazine reported that as a result, Ayyadurai’s "speaking engagements have been canceled, the funding for his e-mail lab has evaporated, and his contract to lecture in MIT’s bioengineering department has been revoked."

And here's the chortle factor:

> Harder further argues that Tomlinson’s work (his RFC #561 describes "network mail" in 1971) is too ancient to be considered proper e-mail.

_Reality is HARD!_
